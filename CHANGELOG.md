- Enabled Launch to Depot.
- Fix for KSRSS tanker running Lqdmethane. The amount of the tanks was not set correctly after I changed it.

- Booster got its own optimised .ksm file that auto-updates.
- Booster code flow optimized for controlling electricity use and cpu load.

- Reworked clamp release (undock) and refueling procedure.
- Booster engines throttle up before clamp release.
- The launch procedure uses less CPU time now, improving performance on slow computers.
- Further bug fixes.

# V2.1.13 (2023-10-12)
- Script now warns of too high inclination to do an automatic de-orbit burn before suggesting fuel venting.
- Winch/LR Antenna buttons greyed out to highlight that they are not yet implemented.
- Booster switches to docking mode after landing.

- Too many other bugfixes and changes to list.
- Started work on RSS capability, but it's still buggy. (if you want to try: install RSS, but don't apply SEPs realism overhaul patch in the extras folder of SEP)

# V1.0.6b (2022-12-03)
- Fixed an issue causing the deorbit-finder to stop early.
- Fixed Mechazilla missing a command by brute forcing my way to success.
- Made the Ship have a 25cm higher target Radar Altitude on Landing into the Mechazilla so the flaps stay healthy more often (read: don't get destroyed by the arms).

- Small bugfixes in many items.
- landing zone gets the slope checked again (turned that off by accident).

    - "Execute Burn" now shows Burn timestamp, delta-V required, burn time and type of thrust used (Vac engines or RCS thrusters).
- Realigned crew images on the Crew Page.
- Removed "Configurable Containers" and "AnimatedAttachment" from mods that don't work with the Interface (patch changed).
- Made a dictionary of known launch sites, which can be used for selecting a landing zone instead of a big bunch of code.
- Fixed all the booster landing issues that occured when not launching from the KSC (problems due to elevation, etc).
- Multiple OLMs can now be used for launching from and landing onto:
    - Many bugs in the re-entry and landing were fixed to allow landings everywhere.
    - Because of changes, also fixes for Duna Landings and the Mun.
    - The OLMs get assigned a name based on a dictionary with known launch sites. Only these bases allow a Mechazilla catch now.

- Overhauled the indexing of all ships parts, and the calculation of all Masses. Shows correct mass and delta-v of the ship that the Interface belongs to while being docked to another.
- Fixed overlapping Interfaces for up to 2 ships in close proximity. The Interface for the active ship will always be on top, and the inactive ship below. When docked: crew or cargo on top, tanker at the bottom. crew + cargo will still overlap.
- Fixed a bug where the ship would steer the wrong way during re-entry.
- New calculation of the flap angles to reflect that they need time to move (actual values are unfortunately not shared by the mod).
- New temperature calculation for the heatshield (still just eye-candy).
- Improved Duna Landings (no oscillations found anymore).

- When EVA'ing during fuel vent the Interface no longer hangs.
- When clicking 'log data' and no connection is available, the Interface no longer crashes.
- Fixed an Interface crash upon booster separation (a small time delay avoids looking for the Booster when it hasn't fully separated yet).

# V1.0.4c (2022-10-24)
- Fixed a bug when confirming a planned maneuver too close to the start of the burn.

# V1.0.4b (2022-10-11)

- Fixed an issue causing the booster to sometimes land a few meters offset from the actual target (target was set wrongly).
- Fixed some mun landing bugs.

# V1.0.4a (2022-10-07)
- Fixed some Mun Landing Bugs.
- Planning a de-orbit on the mun will always plan a point 8km over the Landing Zone before landing vertically.
- Single/Dual engine landings now show only one or two engine running on the engines page.
- Mun landings are smoother and less scary (at the cost of a little delta-v).

# V1.0.4 (2022-10-06)
- Preliminary Mun Automatic De-Orbit & Landing capability introduced.
- Major change to the process of looking for a suitable de-orbit trajectory.
    - I sacrificed looking 6 hours ahead for a de-orbit for a faster and more reliable lookup of only the 1 orbit ahead.
- Added a sticker on the homepage of the Interface to identify which Ships Interface you're looking at (useful when you have multiple craft close by in orbit).
- Fixed some minor bugs I found.

# V1.0.3a (2022-09-12)
- Fixed a crash that happened after undocking.

# V1.0.3 (2022-09-07)
- Fixed an issue where the correct Angle-of-Attack would not be correctly set when transferring from Duna to Kerbin, causing a failure of the auto de-orbit function.
- Introduced a new function that automatically dumps excess fuel during the re-entry after a manual de-orbit, to avoid returning manually, activating the re-entry procedure only and failing the landing due to too high Mass (and fuel).
- Fixed an issue with the Crew Ship. Due to the increased mass of the crew module, the flaps didn't have their proper neutral angle. Reduced Crew Module Mass slightly (15t now vs. SEP default 10t).
- Fixed the acceleration (g-force) measuring that I broke some time ago.
- Fixed an issue where the Center of Gravity was affected when Community Resource Pack was installed, resulting in failed ship re-entries.

# V1.0.2e
- Changed the Boosters final approach mechanism. Fixes the overshooting/undershooting due to users having a different Booster trajectory than I have (still to be investigated).

# V1.0.2d
- Added these mods as incompatible mods that I can't figure out a patch for: ConfigurableContainers and AnimatedAttachment.

# V1.0.2c
- Fix for auto-update loop on startup.

# V1.0.2b
- Changed the patch to hopefully make things more reliable for users with many mods. In case a mod is detected that is not compatible no kOS modules will be added to the vehicle and therefore failing to load the interface.

# V1.0.2a
- Fixed the patch to work with the CryoTanks mod.

# V1.0.2
- Due to BIG structural and procedural CHANGES please dispose of (or land) any already existing starships in your savegame to avoid kerbal deaths!
- Booster/Ship flight profile is now flatter:
    - Booster has more fuel and the ship has less fuel, better matching the real starship.
    - Booster glides more during final re-entry.
- Reconfigured the fuel tanks for more consistency:
    - Methane - Oxidizer ratio is now 1 : 3.6.
    - Liquid Fuel - Oxidizer ratio is now 1 : 3.6.
    - RCS more efficient (to simulate running on ullage gas).
- Ship now supports both 6 and 9-engine versions (you need to modify the craft yourself).
- Fixed missing circulation-fan symbol on the crew page.
- Orbit Insertion Burn is slightly more accurate.
- Launch to Rendezvous text bug fixed.

# V1.0.1c
- More reliable Booster Engine Mode switching.

- More reliable auto-updating itself.
- Yet another delta-v calculation crash fixed.

# V1.0.1a
- Ship mass correct during launch.
- More hudtexts built in to inform the user.
- Delta-V Calculation fixed. It caused a crash when some required value returned a false value.
- Fixed background update while waiting for launch to rendezvous.
- Fixed tower cpu to allow for latest update of SLE to work.

# V1.0.1
- New Ships will from now on *automatically update* (if a connection to the KSC is available) on loading when you download and install a new version of my interface!
    - This means you won't have to delete all the active ships (and create new ships at the VAB) anymore.
    - Start-Up will take a few seconds longer.
    - Old ships of V1.0.0 or before can still be updated if they have a radio connection and the following commands are issued from the kOS CPU:
        - switch to 0.
        - run starship.
- Auto-Docking has received some small fixes.
- 'Cargo Mass' is now correct when docked. Ship Mass and Delta-V have been blocked.

# V1.0.0
- First Release!!
