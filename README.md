# KSP Starship kOS Interface
- A **kOS Interface** for the **Starship Expansion Project** in Kerbal Space Program

User guide: [Wiki](https://github.com/Janus1992/KSP_Starship-kOS-Interface/wiki)

### Credits:
- Original Script: Janus92
- Vehicle pictograms: Space_I_Isaac


## Current State:
- Ship landings/catches and Booster might be inconsistent
- This fork is currently worked on by Nubro.

### Known Issues:
- **Using the (old) provided Craft Files you might have to change the Fuel levels back and forth one time in the VAB to prevent Fuel overload on first launch**
- **Multiple ships/towers of the same name:**
    - Can cause issues where the wrong ship gets loaded during launch.
- Booster might land in front of the tower, due to differrent possible descent trajectories with KSP
    - **If your Booster lands beside/in front of the Tower, use [Frisk's fork](https://github.com/Frisk-33/KSP_Starship-kOS-Interface/tree/patch-1) for a potential patch (RSS only)**
- SQD may not rotate away on Lift-Off (SLE bug I think)
- Engines are engaged and gimballing during re-entry. This is important for the scripts to be able to read pitch commands.
- **Occasionally there may be glitches in the script, like not finding a suitable trajectory (circulating the orbit helps mostly) or crashing on something silly. There's usually not a lot I can do about these things. Sorry..**


## Installation:
- **Download and install all requirements listed below.**
- Download the latest release .zip
- Extract the contents to a folder.
- Move the contents of the _/Kerbal Space Program_ folder (_GameData_ and _Ships_ folders) into your /Kerbal Space Program folder (and overwrite if you are updating).

**Correct folder structure:**
  - _Kerbal Space Program/GameData/StarshipInterface_    (location of the patch)
  - _Kerbal Space Program/Ships/Script_                  (here the kOS scripts are saved)
  - _Kerbal Space Program/Ships/VAB_                     (location of the .craft files)
      - you can also move the .craft files you need directly to your main save
        ( *_Kerbal Space Program/saves/<saveTitle>/Ships/VAB_* )


## Requirements:
- Stock-size Kerbin or Real Solar System or KSRSS or SigmaDimensions (2.5-2.7x)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Use the provided .craft files (e.g. _Starship Cargo_) located inside the stock craft category in the VAB's vessel loading menu (left hand side). This needs _stock vehicles_ enabled in your savegame.
> - Real Solar System: use _Starship ... Real Size_.
> - If you want to create your own craft, use [the guide](https://github.com/Nubro24/KSP_Starship-kOS-Interface/blob/main/HowToMakeACraftFile.md) for important info

### Bug support guide:
- First **carefully** read this whole page! Remember there is no such thing as perfect code, and there will be errors that happen either due my scripts or just because of KSP and its unpredictability. If errors happen consistently, try the following:
- Remove SEP/SLE/Interface and reinstall from the links above (dev versions).
- Move all unnecessary mods away from _/gamedata_ temporarily.
- Keep the kOS CPUs open (right hand side) and screenshot any errors.
- Either:
    - File an issue on github, or
    - Write Nubro on: SEP Discord
- Be sure to describe the problem as accurately as possible and add screenshots/videos.
- Looking forward to your bugs!

> ### By the author:
> This has been a pet project of mine since around May 2021, and I had a lot of fun making and using this Interface. I hope you will too! Let me know what you think! I thank all the mod makers whose work I have been able to rely on, and without whom none of this would have been possible. Especially I want to thank Kari, Sofie, all others that have contributed to SEP and SAMCG14 for his work on SLE.
