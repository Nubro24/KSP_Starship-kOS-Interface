> This has been a pet project of mine since around May 2021, and I had a lot of fun making and using this Interface. I hope you will too! Let me know what you think! I thank all the mod makers whose work I have been able to rely on, and without whom none of this would have been possible. Especially I want to thank Kari, Sofie, all others that have contributed to SEP and SAMCG14 for his work on SLE.
